- **Refrigerators**: Temperature control, eco mode, vacation mode, and other refrigerator-specific features
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connection for instant status updates
- **Automatic Discovery**: Automatically discovers and adds all your Haier Evo devices
- **HomeKit Integration**: Native HomeKit support for all device features

## Supported Devices

- **Air Conditioners**: All Haier Evo compatible air conditioners
- **Refrigerators**: All Haier Evo compatible refrigerators
- **Other Devices**: Any device compatible with the Haier Evo app

## Compatibility

This plugin supports devices that work with the Haier Evo app in the following regions:

- ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º Russia (RU)
- ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¿ Kazakhstan (KZ)
- ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¾ Belarus (BY)

## Installation

1. Install Homebridge if you haven't already.

2. Install this plugin using one of these methods:

   ```bash
   # Using Homebridge UI
   # Search for "homebridge-haier-evo" in the plugins tab

   # Using hb-service
   hb-service add homebridge-haier-evo

   # Using npm
   npm install -g homebridge-haier-evo
   ```

3. Add the platform to your Homebridge configuration file (`config.json`) or use the Homebridge UI to configure it:

   ```json
   {
     "platforms": [
       {
         "platform": "homebridge-haier-evo",
         "name": "Haier Evo",
         "email": "your-email@example.com",
         "password": "your-password",
         "region": "ru",
         "refreshInterval": 300,
         "debug": false
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. Restart Homebridge

### GitHub Actions Workflows

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated testing, version management, and publishing to npm.

#### Test Workflows

1. **Standard Tests**: Runs on every push and pull request
   - Unit tests, device tests, and rate limiting tests
   - No real API access required

2. **Comprehensive Tests**: Manually triggered workflow
   - Can run device tests or rate limiting tests
   - No real API access required

#### Release Process

1. **Create a Release**:
   - Go to the Actions tab in the GitHub repository
   - Select the "Create Release" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Choose the version bump type (patch, minor, major)
   - Click "Run workflow"

2. **Publishing to npm**:
   - After a release is created, the "Node.js Package" workflow automatically runs
   - It builds, tests, and publishes the package to npm
   - It also updates the CHANGELOG.md file

#### Manual Release Process

You can also use the included script for manual releases:

```bash
# Interactive release process
npm run release

# Quick release with specific version bump
npm run release:patch
npm run release:minor
npm run release:major
```

### Publishing to npm

This project is set up for automatic npm publishing through GitHub Actions:

1. When a GitHub Release is created, the package is automatically published to npm
2. When the "Node.js Package" workflow is manually triggered, the package is published to npm

#### Required GitHub Secrets

For the automated publishing to work, you need to set up the following GitHub secrets:

1. `NPM_TOKEN` - An npm access token with publish permissions
   - Go to your npm account settings
   - Create a new access token with "Automation" type
   - Add it as a repository secret in GitHub

#### Setting up GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions"
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Add the NPM_TOKEN with your npm access token value

#### Manual Publishing

To publish manually:

1. Make sure you have an npm account and are logged in:
   ```bash
   npm login
   ```

2. Run the release script:
   ```bash
   npm run release
   ```

3. The script will:
   - Run tests
   - Bump the version
   - Update the changelog
   - Publish to npm
   - Create a git tag
   - Push changes to GitHub
