# Homebridge Haier Evo Plugin

A Homebridge plugin that integrates Haier Evo devices (air conditioners, refrigerators, etc.) with Apple HomeKit.

This plugin is adapted from the [Home Assistant Haier Evo integration](https://github.com/and7ey/haier_evo) to work with Homebridge.

## Features

- **Air Conditioners**: Full thermostat control with heating/cooling modes, temperature control, fan speed, and swing modes
- **Refrigerators**: Temperature control, eco mode, vacation mode, and other refrigerator-specific features
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connection for instant status updates
- **Automatic Discovery**: Automatically discovers and adds all your Haier Evo devices
- **HomeKit Integration**: Native HomeKit support for all device features

## Supported Devices

- **Air Conditioners**: All Haier Evo compatible air conditioners
- **Refrigerators**: All Haier Evo compatible refrigerators
- **Other Devices**: Any device compatible with the Haier Evo app

## Compatibility

This plugin supports devices that work with the Haier Evo app in the following regions:

- ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º Russia (RU)
- ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¿ Kazakhstan (KZ)
- ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¾ Belarus (BY)

## Installation

1. Install Homebridge if you haven't already:

2. Install this plugin:

   ```bash
   hb-service add homebridge-haier-evo
   ```

3. Add the platform to your Homebridge configuration file (`config.json`):

   ```json
   {
     "platforms": [
       {
         "platform": "homebridge-haier-evo",
         "name": "Haier Evo",
         "email": "your-email@example.com",
         "password": "your-password",
         "region": "ru",
         "refreshInterval": 300,
         "debug": false
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. Restart Homebridge

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

| Parameter | Required | Description | Default |

### API Optimization Options

You can optimize API requests to reduce server load and avoid rate limiting:

| `maxRequestDelay` | No | Maximum delay between requests in milliseconds | `1000` |

### Device Filtering Options

You can control which devices are discovered and added to HomeKit using the following filtering options:

| Parameter | Required | Description | Default |
|-----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `includeDevices` | No | Array of device IDs to include. If specified, only these devices will be added | All devices |
| `excludeDevices` | No | Array of device IDs to exclude | None |
| `includeDeviceTypes` | No | Array of device types to include (e.g., "AC", "REFRIGERATOR") | All types |
| `excludeDeviceTypes` | No | Array of device types to exclude | None |
| `includeNamePattern` | No | Regex pattern for device names to include | All names |
| `excludeNamePattern` | No | Regex pattern for device names to exclude | None |

#### Example Configuration with Filtering

```json
{
  "platform": "HaierEvo",
  "name": "Haier Evo",
  "email": "your-email@example.com",
  "password": "your-password",
  "region": "ru",
  "refreshInterval": 300,
  "debug": false,

  "deviceCacheTTL": 300,
  "requestRandomization": true,
  "minRequestDelay": 100,
  "maxRequestDelay": 1000,

  "includeDevices": ["device-id-1", "device-id-2"],
  "excludeDevices": ["device-id-3"],
  "includeDeviceTypes": ["air_conditioner"],
  "excludeDeviceTypes": ["refrigerator"],
  "includeNamePattern": "Living Room|Kitchen",
  "excludeNamePattern": "Basement"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failed**
   - Verify your email and password are correct
   - Ensure your account is active and not locked
   - Check if your region is supported

2. **Devices Not Appearing**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify the Haier Evo app can see your devices
   - Check if you've configured device filtering options that might be excluding your devices
   - Use `"debug": true` to see detailed logs about which devices are being filtered
   - Check Homebridge logs for error messages

3. **Commands Not Working**
   - Ensure the device is online in the Haier Evo app
   - Check if the device supports the specific feature
   - Restart Homebridge

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting `"debug": true` in your configuration:

```json
{
  "platform": "homebridge-haier-evo",
  "name": "Haier Evo",
  "email": "your-email@example.com",
  "password": "your-password",
  "region": "ru",
  "debug": true
}
```

### Logs

Check Homebridge logs for detailed information:

```bash
